                <p>
                    Starting my career as a UX Designer, and moving
                    into Digital Project Management, I have accumulated
                    a wide range of digital skills that has helped me
                    deliver best in class digital and design projects
                    both in local and global markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve built and maintained strong client relationships,
                    developing new business opportunities through existing
                    clients. I’m eager to be involved in new projects from
                    the creative and conceptual thinking stage, all the way
                    through to delivery. Passionate about working in a team
                    and developing junior members, I have strong experience
                    in both line management and in-house recruitment.

                    Below are the projects that I’ve worked on in my spare
                    time that (hopefully) demonstrate both my development
                    and in some instances my design skills. All of these
                    have been built 100% by me, bar the use of specific
                    libraries, such as Slick, and third party APIs such
                    as in the Tfl example.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each project focused on learning or mastering a specific
                    concept or feature within web development, and as I have
                    worked on these over a period of years, they do naturally
                    vary in quality.
