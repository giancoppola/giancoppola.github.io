                  <p>
                    I started out in the classic way. I studied business
                    administration, then got into management consulting, and
                    joined Barclays as a business design analyst in 2014. I did
                    the Scrum Master and had a lot of fun driving Scrum forward
                    for two years. This caught the eye of another department and
                    I was advised to apply to Sales & Quality as a team leader.
                    So I got my first team responsibility with 15 employees,
                    with whom I achieved a lot - for us and our customers. My
                    manager and the HR department actively supported me here and
                    accompanied my development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, while I was working, I completed a two year
                    course of study and received a scholarship for the Young
                    Women Leadership Program. Human Resources was actively
                    supportive here and I was able to move to the team leader
                    position at Commercial Marketing. I then spent one year
                    leading one of the most important projects at Barclays for
                    the marketing division. Today, I'm a team leader in Customer
                    Campaigns.

                  take advantage of opportunities has defined my career - and

                    I started at Barclays as a temporary employee in Application
                    Processing in 2002. I liked the company, the work was fun,
                    and a position became available. I applied and took the job.
                    My curiosity for new things at Barclays was piqued – I
                    wanted to grow with the company. I then took the opportunity
                    to move into dunning Customer Service and had my first
                    contact with marketing. And I wanted more. So I went for
                    evening studies in Marketing Communications, plus a
                    marketing internship with Barclays’ support. Setting up and
                    expanding online marketing sales became my passion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Being actively involved and taking on additional
                    responsibility and tasks helped me make it to the manager
                    level. With renewed motivation, I added a Business
                    Administration degree and a bachelor's degree to achieve my
                    further goals. Now, I work in the COO area with my own team
                    and can shape digital transformation.

                    My tasks at Barclays are always an exciting challenge for
                    me. At its core, I deal with the question: How can the
                    bank's earnings potential be increased? Since I studied
                    Business Administration and I’m interested in business
                    processes at banks, the current job is right up my alley.
                    It's all about interest rate adjustments or optimising the
                    product range. I started at Barclays in the change area as a
                    Business Design Analyst in 2013. There I worked with many
                    departments and got to know the system and process
                    infrastructure in detail.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This allowed me to lead many exciting, innovative projects.
                    For example, the digitisation of the application process. In
                    2014, I moved to Product Management, where I managed
                    exciting projects in the Loans and Deposits department. Five
                    years later I had the opportunity to build a new Product
                    Management team in 'Commercial Optimisation'. We are a great
                    and successful team and are launching many new measures.

                  “I’ve been very lucky in my career at Barclays. But I’ve also
                  earned it. If you want to develop, it’s important to think
                  outside the box in your line of work. In my case, that was
                  interdisciplinary exciting projects and that I built up a
                  network across the different departments.”

                    Coming to Barclays as a trained cook. Sounds unusual. But
                    it’s a fit. After working as a chef, I wanted to study and
                    got a student job in the Fraud department in 2009. I enjoyed
                    that a lot and was fully committed. My team leader, who was
                    in the process of building a new team, asked me if I would
                    like to do more. I did. After a year, the student job turned
                    into a permanent position. Next came a big project where I
                    worked very well with an English colleague.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then I got another offer from a team leader. Here it was
                    about customer communication in cases of fraud and the whole
                    process documentation. At this job, the Compliance
                    department noticed me and I got the chance to take a job
                    there. I still work here today and take over responsibility
                    for financial crime prevention.
