                                        I started out in the classic way. I studied business
                                        administration, then got into management consulting,
                                        and joined Barclays as a business design analyst in 2014.
                                        I did the Scrum Master and had a lot of fun driving Scrum
                                        forward for two years. This caught the eye of another
                                        department and I was advised to apply to Sales & Quality
                                        as a team leader. So I got my first team responsibility with
                                        15 employees, with whom I achieved a lot - for us and our
                                        customers. My manager and the HR department actively supported
                                        me here and accompanied my development.

                                        of study and received a scholarship for the Young Women Leadership
                                        Program. Human Resources was actively supportive here and I was
                                        able to move to the team leader position at Commercial Marketing.
                                        I then spent one year leading one of the most important projects
                                        at Barclays for the marketing division. Today, I'm a team leader
                                        in Customer Campaigns.

                                        I started out in the classic way. I studied business
                                        administration, then got into management consulting,
                                        and joined Barclays as a business design analyst in 2014.
                                        I did the Scrum Master and had a lot of fun driving Scrum
                                        forward for two years. This caught the eye of another
                                        department and I was advised to apply to Sales & Quality
                                        as a team leader. So I got my first team responsibility with
                                        15 employees, with whom I achieved a lot - for us and our
                                        customers. My manager and the HR department actively supported
